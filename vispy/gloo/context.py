"""
Functionality to deal with GL Contexts in vispy. This module is defined
in gloo, because gloo (and the layers that depend on it) need to be
context aware. The vispy.app module "provides" a context, and therefore
depends on this module. Although the GLContext class is aimed for use
by vispy.app (for practical reasons), it should be possible to use
GLContext without using vispy.app by overloading it in an appropriate
manner.

An GLContext object acts as a placeholder on which different parts
of vispy (or other systems) can keep track of information related to
an OpenGL context.
